## Chicago Police Department: Violence Reduction - Shotspotter Alerts 

The report on the Chicago Police Department’s use of ShotSpotter alerts analyzes gunshot incidents to understand spatial and temporal trends and develop predictive models. Key research questions address whether specific neighborhoods experience higher incident rates, the correlation of incidents with times of day or week, and the potential for a model to predict incident types.

### Three modeling approaches were explored,
1. The GLM-logistic regression model identified significant predictors like a month, day of the week, number of rounds, and longitude, showing promising but improvable results in classifying incidents
2. The decision tree model, with high accuracy and a robust AUC score, demonstrated exceptional predictive performance
3. The linear regression model, while identifying some significant factors, had limited explanatory power regarding incident frequency, suggesting a need for further refinement

Overall, the report underscores the importance of model selection based on specific goals to enhance law enforcement’s response to firearm incidents and improve community safety
